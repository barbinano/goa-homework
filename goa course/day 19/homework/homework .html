    <p id="eagle">Eagle is the common name for the golden eagle, bald eagle, and other birds of prey in the family of
        the Accipitridae. Eagles belong to several groups of genera, some of which are closely related. True eagles
        comprise the genus Aquila. Most of the 68 species of eagles are from Eurasia and Africa.[1] Outside this area,
        just 14 species can be found—two in North America, nine in Central and South America, and three in Australia.

        Eagles are not a natural group but denote essentially any kind of bird of prey large enough to hunt sizeable
        (about 50 cm long or more overall) vertebrates.

        Etymology
        The word "eagle" is borrowed into English from Anglo-Norman: eagle and Middle French: aigle, both derived
        ultimately from Latin: aquila ("eagle"). It is cognate with terms such as French: aigle, Portuguese: águia and
        Spanish: águila.[2] It is broadly synonymous with the less common English term "erne" or "earn", deriving from
        Middle English: ern, from Old English: earn, in which it acts as the usual word for the bird. The Old English
        term is turn derived from Proto-Germanic: *arnaz and is cognate with other synonymous words in Germanic
        languages such as Swedish: örn, German: Aar and Gothic: ara. Through the Proto-Indo-European root, it is further
        related to words such as ὄρνις ("bird") and Lithuanian: erelis ("eagle"). Although "erne" can be used to refer
        to any eagle, it is most commonly used for the golden eagle or sea-eagle.[3][4]

        Description
        Eagles are large, powerfully-built birds of prey, with heavy heads and beaks. Even the smallest eagles, such as
        the booted eagle (Hieraaetus pennatus), which is comparable in size to a common buzzard (Buteo buteo) or
        red-tailed hawk (B. jamaicensis), have relatively longer and more evenly broad wings, and more direct, faster
        flight, despite the reduced size of their aerodynamic feathers. Most eagles are larger than any other raptors,
        apart from some vultures. The smallest species of eagle is the Great Nicobar serpent eagle (Spilornis klossi),
        at 450 g (1 lb) and 40 cm (16 in). The largest species are discussed below. Like all birds of prey, eagles have
        very large hooked beaks for ripping flesh from their prey, strong, muscular legs, and powerful talons.

        The beak is typically heavier than that of most other birds of prey. Eagles' eyes are extremely powerful. It is
        estimated that the wedge-tailed eagle has a visual acuity twice that of a typical human.[5][6][7] This acuity
        enables eagles to spot potential prey from a very long distance. This keen eyesight is primarily attributed to
        their extremely large pupils which ensure minimal diffraction (scattering) of the incoming light. Like most
        diurnal raptors, eagles have little ability to see ultraviolet light.[8] The female of all known species of
        eagles is larger than the male.[9][10]

        Eagles normally build their nests, called eyries, in tall trees or on high cliffs. Many species lay two eggs,
        but the older, larger chick frequently kills its younger sibling once it has hatched. The parents take no action
        to stop the killing.[11][12] It is said[by whom?] that eagles fly above clouds but this is not true.[citation
        needed] Eagles fly during storms and glide from the wind's pressure. This saves the bird's energy. Due to the
        size and power of many eagle species, they are ranked at the top of the food chain as apex predators in the
        avian world. The type of prey varies by genus. The Haliaeetus and Icthyophaga eagles prefer to capture fish,
        though the species in the former often capture various animals, especially other water birds, and are powerful
        kleptoparasites of other birds. The snake and serpent eagles of the genera Circaetus, Terathopius, and Spilornis
        predominantly prey on the great diversity of snakes found in the tropics of Africa and Asia. The eagles of the
        genus Aquila are often the top birds of prey in open habitats, taking almost any medium-sized vertebrate they
        can catch. Where Aquila eagles are absent, other eagles, such as the buteonine black-chested buzzard-eagle of
        South America, may assume the position of top raptorial predator in open areas. Many other eagles, including the
        species-rich genus Spizaetus, live predominantly in woodlands and forests. These eagles often target various
        arboreal or ground-dwelling mammals and birds, which are often unsuspectingly ambushed in such dense, knotty
        environments. Hunting techniques differ among the species and genera, with some individual eagles having engaged
        in quite varied techniques based on their environment and prey at any given time. Most eagles grab prey without
        landing and take flight with it, so the prey can be carried to a perch and torn apart.[13]

        The bald eagle is noted for having flown with the heaviest load verified to be carried by any flying bird, since
        one eagle flew with a 6.8 kg (15 lb) mule deer fawn.[14][15] However, a few eagles may target prey considerably
        heavier than themselves; such prey is too heavy to fly with, thus it is either eaten at the site of the kill or
        taken in pieces back to a perch or nest. Golden and crowned eagles have killed ungulates weighing up to 30 kg
        (66 lb) and a martial eagle even killed a 37 kg (82 lb) duiker, 7–8 times heavier than the preying
        eagle.[13]: 67–68 [16] Authors on birds David Allen Sibley, Pete Dunne, and Clay Sutton described the behavioral
        difference between hunting eagles and other birds of prey thus (in this case the bald and golden eagles as
        compared to other North American raptors):[17]


        An Eagle named in honor of Abraham Lincoln and was the mascot of 8th Wisconsin Infantry Regiment, at the time of
        the U.S. Centennial
        They have at least one singular characteristic. It has been observed that most birds of prey look back over
        their shoulders before striking prey (or shortly thereafter); predation is after all a two-edged sword. All
        hawks seem to have this habit, from the smallest kestrel to the largest Ferruginous – but not the Eagles.

        Among the eagles are some of the largest birds of prey: only the condors and some of the Old World vultures are
        markedly larger. It is regularly debated[according to whom?] which should be considered the largest species of
        eagle. They could be measured variously in total length, body mass, or wingspan. Different lifestyle needs among
        various eagles result in variable measurements from species to species. For example, many forest-dwelling
        eagles, including the very large harpy eagle, have relatively short wingspans, a feature necessary for being
        able to maneuver in quick, short bursts through densely forested habitats.[13] Eagles in the genus Aquila, found
        almost exclusively in open country, are noted for their ability to soar, and have relatively long wings for
        their size.[13]

        These lists of the top five eagles are based on weight, length, and wingspan, respectively. Unless otherwise
        noted by reference, the figures listed are the median reported for each measurement in the guide Raptors of the
        World[18] in which only measurements that could be personally verified by the authors were listed.[13]

        Habitat
        The eagles are generally distributed in all types of habitats and nearly all parts of the world. The birds can
        be found in northern tundra to tropical rainforests and deserts. In North America, bald eagles and golden eagles
        are very common.

        Groups
        Eagles are often informally divided into four groups.[a][24]

        The snake eagles are placed in the subfamily Circaetinae. The fish eagles, booted eagles, and harpy eagles have
        traditionally been placed in the subfamily Buteoninae together with the buzzard-hawks (buteonine hawks) and
        harriers. Some authors may treat these groups as tribes of the Buteoninae; Lerner & Mindell[25] proposed
        separating the eagle groups into their own subfamilies of Accipitridae.

        Fish eagles
        Sea eagles or fish eagles take fish as a large part of their diets, either fresh or as carrion.

        Proposed subfamily Haliaeetinae. Genera: Haliaeetus, Icthyophaga.

        Some authors include Gypohierax angolensis, the "vulturine fish eagle" (also called the palm-nut vulture) in
        this group.[24] However, genetic analyses indicate it is related to a grouping of Neophron–Gypaetus–Eutriorchis
        (Egyptian vulture, bearded vulture (lammergeier), and Madagascar serpent eagle).[26]

        The fish eagles have a close genetic relationship with Haliastur and Milvus; the whole group is only distantly
        related to the Buteo group.[26]

        Fish eagles exist in every continent throughout the world, except for South America.[27]

        Although fish eagles can be found in many different places around the world, they have been classified as "Near
        Threatened". Reasons such as overfishing, pollution, habitat destruction, and the use of pesticides have
        contributed to the species' rapid population drop.[28]

        Booted eagles
        Booted eagles or "true eagles"[24][29] have feathered tarsi (lower legs).

        Tribe Aquililae or proposed subfamily Aquilinae. Genera: Aquila, Hieraaetus; Spizaetus, Oroaetus, Spizastur;
        Nisaetus;[26] Ictinaetus, Lophoaetus; Polemaetus; and Stephanoaetus.[24][29]

        See comments under eagle species for changes to the composition of these genera.

        Snake eagles
        Most snake or serpent eagles, as the name suggests, primarily prey on snakes.

        Subfamily Circaetinae. Genera: Circaetus, Spilornis, Dryotriorchis, Terathopius.[24]
        Eutriorchis (subfamily Gypaetinae or Circaetinae).
        Despite filling the niche of a snake eagle, genetic studies suggest that the Madagascar serpent eagle
        (Eutriorchis) is not related to them.[26]

        Over several decades, a great deal of research has been done on the Snake-eagle's diet, which is mainly made up
        of reptiles, especially snakes. When it comes to catching snakes, it is generally accepted that the bird
        exhibits generalist feeding behavior, which means it does not hunt down specific types of snakes but rather
        feeds on them depending on their availability in the wild.[30]

        Harpy eagles
        Harpy eagles[24] or "giant forest eagles"[23] are large eagles that inhabit tropical forests. The group contains
        two to six species, depending on the author. Although these birds occupy similar niches and have traditionally
        been grouped, they are not all related: the solitary eagles are related to the black hawks and the Philippine
        eagle to the snake eagles.

        Harpy eagles (proposed subfamily Harpiinae)
        Harpia harpyja, harpy eagle ― Central and South America.
        Morphnus guianensis, crested eagle ― Central and South America.
        Harpyopsis novaeguineae, Papuan eagle ― New Guinea.
        Philippine eagle
        Pithecophaga jefferyi, Philippine eagle ― Philippines.
        Solitary eagles
        Chaco eagle or crowned solitary eagle, Buteogallus (formerly Harpyhaliaetus) coronatus ― South America.
        Solitary eagle or montane solitary eagle, Buteogallus (formerly Harpyhaliaetus) solitarius ― South America.

        Wedge-tailed eagle in Australia

        Eastern imperial eagle in Israel
        Major new research into eagle taxonomy suggests that the important genera Aquila and Hieraaetus are not composed
        of nearest relatives, and it is likely that a reclassification of these genera will soon take place, with some
        species being moved to Lophaetus or Ictinaetus.[25]

        Bonelli's eagle and the African hawk-eagle have been moved from Hieraaetus to Aquila.
        Either the greater spotted eagle and lesser spotted eagle should move from Aquila to join the long-crested eagle
        in Lophaetus, or, perhaps better, all three of these species should move to Ictinaetus with the black eagle.
        The steppe eagle and tawny eagle, once thought to be conspecific, are not even each other's nearest relatives.

        In culture

        Etymology
        The modern English term for the bird is derived from Latin: aquila by way of French: aigle. The origin of aquila
        is unknown, but it is believed to possibly derive from aquilus (meaning dark-colored, swarthy, or blackish) as a
        reference to the plumage of eagles.

        Old English used the term earn, related to Scandinavia's ørn/örn. It is similar to other Indo-European terms for
        "bird" or "eagle", including Greek: ὄρνις (ornís), Russian: орёл (orël), and Welsh: eryr.

        In the southern part of Finland, near the Gulf of Finland, is the town of Kotka, which literally means "eagle",
        while the town of L'Aquila in the central part of Italy literally means "the eagle".


        The sculpture of eagle at the top of the fountain at Plac Orła Białego in Szczecin, Poland
        In Britain before 1678, eagle referred specifically to the golden eagle, with the other native species, the
        white-tailed eagle, being known as erne. The modern name "golden eagle" for aquila chrysaetos was introduced by
        the naturalist John Ray.[31]

        The village of Eagle in Lincolnshire, England, has nothing to do with the bird; its name is derived from the Old
        English words for "oak" and "wood" (compare Oakley).[32]

        Religion and spirituality

        Representation of an eagle at Rio Carnival, 2014

        Garuda, the vahana (mount) of Vishnu, depicted with an eagle's beak and wings
        In the ancient Sumerian mythology, the mythical king Etana was said to have been carried into heaven by an
        eagle.[33] Classical writers such as Lucan and Pliny the Elder claimed that the eagle was able to look directly
        at the sun, and that they forced their fledglings to do the same. Those that blinked would be cast from the
        nest. This belief persisted until the Medieval era.[34]

        The eagle is the patron animal of the ancient Greek god Zeus. In particular, Zeus was said to have taken the
        form of an eagle in order to abduct Ganymede, and there are numerous artistic depictions of the eagle Zeus
        bearing Ganymede aloft, from Classical times up to the present (see illustrations in the Ganymede (mythology)
        page.)[35]

        Eagles appear metaphorically in many translations of the Old Testament. God is spoken of as carrying Israel on
        "eagles' wings" in Exodus 19:4, Isaiah 40:31 compares those who wait on the Lord to flying eagles, and Psalm 103
        mentions renewing one's youth "as the eagle". In explaining this rejuvenation, Augustine of Hippo says in his
        commentary on the Psalms that eagles' beaks overgrow as they age and that they break them against rocks to
        restore them.[36] The translation, however, is uncertain: the word in the Hebrew, נשר, can also be translated
        vulture,[37] and is listed alongside specific kinds of vulture in Leviticus' discussion of unclean animals.

        The eagle is also often used in Christian iconography to represent the Gospel of John,[38] and eagle-shaped
        lecterns are common in Anglican and some Roman Catholic churches.[39] The eagle was believed to be able to look
        directly into the sun in the same way that the Gospel of John looks directly at Jesus' divinity, and the great
        distances the eagle flies represent the spread of the gospel to the ends of the earth.

        The United States eagle feather law stipulates that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry
        enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain eagle feathers for religious or
        spiritual reasons.[40] In Canada, the poaching of eagle feathers for the booming U.S. market has sometimes
        resulted in the arrests of First Nations person for the crime.[41]

        The Moche people of ancient Peru worshiped the eagle and often depicted eagles in their art.[42] The golden
        eagle was sacred to the Aztec god Huitzilopochtli while the harpy eagle was sacred to Quetzalcoatl.[43]

        Coat of arms of Austria.

        Coat of arms of Kotka, Finland

        Coat of arms of the United States
        Eagles are an exceptionally common symbol in heraldry, being considered the "King of Birds" in contrast to the
        lion, the "King of Beasts". Whereas the lion (e.g. England) usually represents authority, the eagle is the
        symbol of power. They are particularly popular in Germanic countries such as Austria, due to their association
        with the Holy Roman Empire. The eagle of the Holy Roman Empire was two-headed, supposedly representing the two
        divisions, East and West, of the old Roman Empire. This motif, derived from the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire
        was also adopted by the Russian Empire and is still featured in the Flag of Albania. The Roman eagle was
        preceded by the eagle of Ptolemaic Egypt and the Achaemenid Empire. In the coat of arms of Kotka, Finland, the
        eagle is depicted carrying an anchor and the caduceus on its feet.

        Heraldic eagles are most often found displayed, i.e. with their wings and legs extended. They can also occur
        close, i.e. with their wings folded, or rising, i.e. about to take flight. The heads, wings, and legs of eagles
        can also be found independently.

        Eagles symbolize strength, courage, and independence and are commonly found in the heraldry of many nations
        across the world. Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Austria, Dagestan, Egypt, Germany, Ghana, Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan,
        Kazakhstan, Mexico, Montenegro, Nigeria, Philippines, Poland, Palestine, Panama, Russia, Romania, Serbia, South
        Sudan, Somaliland, Syria, the United States of America, Yemen, Zambia, and Zimbabwe are the nations whose coats
        of arms feature an eagle. The eagle's continuing significance and worldwide appeal as a forceful symbol in
        national identity and imagery is demonstrated by its widespread usage.[44]

        Notes
        "There are four major groups of eagles: fish eagles, booted eagles, snake eagles and giant forest eagles."[23]

        Geographic range of the family
        Columbidae is a bird family consisting of doves and pigeons. It is the only family in the order Columbiformes.
        These are stout-bodied birds with small heads, relatively short necks and slender bills that in some species
        feature fleshy ceres. They feed largely on plant matter, feeding on seeds (granivory), fruit (frugivory), and
        foliage (folivory).

        In colloquial English, the smaller species tend to be called "doves", and the larger ones "pigeons",[2] although
        the distinction is not consistent,[2] and there is no scientific separation between them.[3] Historically, the
        common names for these birds involve a great deal of variation. The bird most commonly referred to as "pigeon"
        is the domestic pigeon, descendant of the wild rock dove, which is a common inhabitant of cities as the feral
        pigeon.`

        Columbidae contains 51 genera divided into 353 species.[4] The family occurs worldwide, often in close proximity
        to humans, but the greatest diversity is in the Indomalayan and Australasian realms. 118 species (34%) are at
        risk,[4] and 13 are extinct,[5] with the most famous examples being the dodo, a large, flightless, island bird,
        and the passenger pigeon, that once flocked in the billions.

        Etymology
        Pigeon is a French word that derives from the Latin pīpiō, for a 'peeping' chick,[6] while dove is an ultimately
        Germanic word, possibly referring to the bird's diving flight.[7] The English dialectal word culver appears to
        derive from Latin columba.[6] A group of doves has sometimes been called a "dule", taken from the French word
        deuil ('mourning').[8][page needed]

        Origin and evolution
        Columbiformes is one of the most diverse non-passerine clades of neoavians, and its origins are in the
        Cretaceous[9] and the result of a rapid diversification at the end of the K-Pg boundary.[10] Whole genome
        analyses have found Columbiformes is the sister clade to the clade Pteroclimesites a clade consisting the orders
        Pterocliformes (sandgrouses) and Mesitornithiformes (mesites).[11][12][13] The columbiform-pteroclimesitean
        clade, or Columbimorphae, monophyly has been supported from several studies.[11][12][14][15][16][17][18][19]

        Taxonomy and systematics
        See also: List of Columbidae genera and List of Columbidae species
        The name 'Columbidae' for the family was first used by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in a guide to
        the contents of the British Museum published in 1819.[20][21] However, Illiger in 1811 established an older name
        for the family group ("Columbini") and would actually be the proper authority for Columbidae.[22]

        The interrelationships of columbids (between subfamilies) and the ergotaxonomy of them has been debated, with
        many different interpretations of how they should be classified. As many as five to six families, along with
        many subfamilies and tribes, have been used in the past including the family Raphidae for the dodo and the
        Rodrigues solitaire.[23][24][25] A 2024 paper on the systematics and nomenclature of the dodo and the solitaire
        from Young and colleagues also provided an overview of columbid family-group nomina. They recommended
        recognizing three subfamilies: Columbinae (New World doves and quail-doves, and columbin doves), Claravinae
        (American ground-doves), and Raphinae (Old World doves and pigeons including the dodo and solitaire).[22] A 2025
        paper on the molecular phylogenetic placement of the Cuban endemic blue-headed quail-dove from Oswald and
        colleagues found the species to be a sister group to Columbinae, as opposed to being a true columbine or a
        raphine as previous authors have suggested in the past. These authors recommended that the blue-headed
        quail-dove should be placed in fourth monotypic subfamily, Starnoenadinae.[26]

        These taxonomic issues are exacerbated by columbids not being well represented in the fossil record,[27] with no
        truly primitive forms having been found to date.[citation needed] The genus Gerandia has been described from
        Early Miocene deposits in France, but while it was long believed to be a pigeon,[28] it is now considered a
        sandgrouse.[29] Fragmentary remains of a probably "ptilinopine" Early Miocene pigeon were found in the
        Bannockburn Formation of New Zealand and described as Rupephaps;[29] "Columbina" prattae from roughly
        contemporary deposits of Florida is nowadays tentatively separated in Arenicolumba, but its distinction from
        Columbina/Scardafella and related genera needs to be more firmly established (e.g. by cladistic analysis).[30]
        Apart from that, all other fossils belong to extant genera.[31]

        Description
        Anatomy and physiology

        A landing collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto) displays the contour and flight feathers of its wings.
        Overall, the anatomy of Columbidae is characterized by short legs, short bills with a fleshy cere, and small
        heads on large, compact bodies.[32] Like some other birds, the Columbidae have no gall bladders.[33] Some
        medieval naturalists concluded they have no bile (gall), which in the medieval theory of the four humours
        explained the allegedly sweet disposition of doves.[34] In fact, however, they do have bile (as Aristotle had
        earlier realized), which is secreted directly into the gut.[35][page needed]

        The wings of most species are large, and have eleven primary feathers;[36] pigeons have strong wing muscles
        (wing muscles comprise 31–44% of their body weight[37]) and are among the strongest fliers of all birds.[36]

        In a series of experiments in 1975 by Dr. Mark B. Friedman, using doves, their characteristic head bobbing was
        shown to be due to their natural desire to keep their vision constant.[38] It was shown yet again in a 1978
        experiment by Dr. Barrie J. Frost, in which pigeons were placed on treadmills; it was observed that they did not
        bob their heads, as their surroundings were constant.[39]

        Feathers

        Pigeon feather types, excluding down
        Columbidae have unique body feathers, with the shaft being generally broad, strong, and flattened, tapering to a
        fine point, abruptly.[36] In general, the aftershaft is absent; however, small ones on some tail and wing
        feathers may be present.[40] Body feathers have very dense, fluffy bases, are attached loosely into the skin,
        and drop out easily.[41] Possibly serving as a predator avoidance mechanism,[42] large numbers of feathers fall
        out in the attacker's mouth if the bird is snatched, facilitating the bird's escape. The plumage of the family
        is variable.[43]

        Granivorous species tend to have dull plumage, with a few exceptions, whereas the frugivorous species have
        brightly coloured plumage.[44][page needed] The genera Chalcophaps, Ptilinopus and Alectroenas include some of
        the most brightly coloured pigeons. Pigeons and doves may be sexually monochromatic or dichromatic.[45] In
        addition to bright colours, some pigeon species may have crests or other ornamentation.[46]


        Snow pigeons flying at an altitude of 12,000 feet (3,700 m) above sea level
        Flight
        Many Columbidae are excellent fliers due to the lift provided by their large wings, which results in low wing
        loading.[47] They are highly maneuverable in flight[48] and have a low aspect ratio due to the width of their
        wings, allowing for quick flight launches and ability to escape from predators, but at a high energy cost.[49] A
        few species are long-distance migrants, with some populations of the European turtle dove migrating in excess of
        5,000 km between northern Europe in summer and tropical Africa in winter, and the Oriental turtle dove nearly as
        far in eastern Asia between eastern Siberia and southern China.

        Size
        Pigeons and doves exhibit considerable variation in size, ranging in length from 15 to 75 centimetres (5.9 to
        29.5 in), and in weight from 30 g (0.066 lb) to above 2,000 g (4.4 lb).[50] The largest extant species are the
        crowned pigeons of New Guinea,[51] which are nearly turkey-sized, with lengths of 66–79 cm (2.17–2.59 ft) and
        weights ranging 1.8–4 kg (4.0–8.8 lb).[52][53][54] One of the largest arboreal species, the Marquesan imperial
        pigeon with a length of 55 cm (22 in), currently battles extinction.[55][page needed][56] The extinct,
        flightless dodo is the largest columbid to have ever existed, with a height of about 62.6–75 cm (24.6–29.5 in),
        and a range of suggested weights from 10.2–27.8 kilograms (22–61 lb), although the higher estimates are thought
        to be based on overweight birds.[57][58][59][60]

        The least massive columbids belong to species in the genus Columbina; the common ground dove (Columbina
        passerina) and the plain-breasted ground dove (Columbina minuta) which are about the same size as a house
        sparrow, weighing a little above 22 g (0.78 oz).[44][page needed][61][62] The dwarf fruit dove, which may
        measure as little as 13 cm (5.1 in) long, has a marginally smaller total length than any other species from this
        family.[44][page needed]

        The Nicobar pigeon (Caloenas nicobarica) is often stated to be the dodo's closest living relative.

        Distribution and habitat
        Pigeons and doves are distributed everywhere on Earth, having adapted to most terrestrial habitats available on
        the planet, except for the driest areas of the Sahara Desert, Antarctica and its surrounding islands, and the
        high Arctic.[50] They have colonised most of the world's oceanic islands, reaching eastern Polynesia and the
        Chatham Islands in the Pacific, Mauritius, the Seychelles and Réunion in the Indian Ocean, and the Azores in the
        Atlantic Ocean.

        Columbid species may be arboreal, terrestrial, or semi-terrestrial. They inhabit savanna, grassland, shrubland,
        desert, temperate woodland and forest, tropical rainforests, mangrove forest, and even the barren sands and
        gravels of atolls.[63]

        Some species have large natural ranges. The eared dove ranges across the entirety of South America from Colombia
        to Tierra del Fuego,[64] the Eurasian collared dove has a massive (if discontinuous) distribution from Britain
        across Europe, the Middle East, India, Pakistan and China,[65] and the laughing dove across most of sub-Saharan
        Africa, as well as India, Pakistan, and the Middle East.[66]

        When including human-mediated introductions, the largest range of any species is that of the rock dove, also
        known as the common pigeon.[67] This species had a large natural distribution from Britain and Ireland to
        northern Africa, across Europe, Arabia, Central Asia, India, the Himalayas and up into China and Mongolia.[67]
        The range of the species increased dramatically upon domestication, as the species went feral in cities around
        the world.[67] The common pigeon is currently resident across most of North America, and has established itself
        in cities and urban areas in South America, sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, Japan, Australia, and New
        Zealand.[67] A 2020 study found that the east coast of the United States includes two pigeon genetic megacities,
        in New York and Boston, and observes that the birds do not mix together.[68]

        As well as the rock dove, several other species of pigeon have become established outside of their natural range
        after escaping captivity, and other species have increased their natural ranges due to habitat changes caused by
        human activity.[44][page needed]

        Other species of Columbidae have tiny, restricted distributions, usually seen on small islands, such as the
        whistling dove, which is endemic to the tiny Kadavu Island in Fiji,[69] the Caroline ground dove, restricted to
        two islands, Truk and Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands,[70] and the Grenada dove, which is only found on the
        island of Grenada in the Caribbean.[71]

        Some continental species also have tiny distributions, such as the black-banded fruit dove, which is restricted
        to a small area of the Arnhem Land of Australia,[72] the Somali pigeon, found only in a tiny area of northern
        Somalia,[73] and Moreno's ground dove, endemic to the area around Salta and Tucuman in northern
        Argentina.[44][page needed]

        Behaviour
        Feeding

        White-bellied green pigeon (Treron sieboldii) feeding on fruit
        Seeds and fruit form the major component of the diets of pigeons and doves,[50][74] and the family can be
        loosely divided between seed-eating (granivorous) species, and fruit-and-mast-eating (frugivorous) species,
        though many species consume both.[75]

        The granivorous species typically feed on seed found on the ground, whereas the frugivorous species are more
        arboreal, tending to feed in trees.[75] The morphological adaptations used to distinguish between the two groups
        include granivores tending to having thick walls in their gizzards, intestines, and esophagi, with the
        frugivores evolved with thin walls,[50] and the fruit-eating species have short intestines, as opposed to the
        seed eaters having longer intestines.[76] Frugivores are capable of clinging to branches and even hang upside
        down to reach fruit.[44][page needed][75]

        In addition to fruit and seeds, a number of other food items are taken by many species. Some, particularly the
        ground doves and quail-doves, eat a large number of prey items such as insects and worms.[75] One species, the
        atoll fruit dove, is specialised in taking insect and reptile prey.[75] Snails, moths, and other insects are
        taken by white-crowned pigeons, orange fruit doves, and ruddy ground doves.[44][page needed] Flowers are also
        taken by some species.[4]

        Urban feral pigeons, descendants of domestic rock doves (Columbia livia), reside in urban environments,
        disturbing their natural feeding habits. They depend on human activities and interactions to obtain food,
        causing them to forage for spilled food or food provided by humans.[77]


        Spotted dove (Spilopelia chinensis) on its nest, with one unhatched egg and one hatchling
        Reproduction
        Doves and pigeons build relatively flimsy nests, often using sticks, other vegetable matter, and other debris,
        which may be placed on trees, on rocky ledges, or on the ground, depending on species. The female may either
        build the nest, with material gathered by the male, or the male builds the nest by himself. A few species nest
        colonially, others nest in aggregation.[4]

        Most lay a clutch of one or (usually) two white eggs at a time which take 11-30 days to hatch (larger species
        have longer incubation times). Both parents care for the young; unlike most birds, both sexes of doves and
        pigeons produce "crop milk" to feed their young. This fluid is secreted by a sloughing of epithelial cells from
        the lining of the crop.[4]

        Unfledged baby doves and pigeons are called squabs and are generally able to fly by five weeks old. These
        fledglings, with their immature squeaking voices, are called squeakers once they are weaned,[78] and leave the
        nest after 25–32 days.

        Status and conservation
        While many species of pigeons and doves have benefited from human activities and have increased their ranges,
        many other species have declined in numbers and some have become threatened or even succumbed to extinction.[79]
        Among the ten species to have become extinct since 1600 (the conventional date for estimating modern
        extinctions) are two of the most famous extinct species, the dodo and the passenger pigeon.[79][4]

        The passenger pigeon was exceptional for a number of reasons. In modern times, it is the only pigeon species
        that was not an island species to have become extinct[79] even though it was once the most numerous species of
        bird on Earth.[citation needed] Its former numbers are difficult to estimate, but one ornithologist, Alexander
        Wilson, estimated one flock he observed contained over two billion birds.[80] The decline of the species was
        abrupt; in 1871, a breeding colony was estimated to contain over a hundred million birds, yet the last
        individual in the species was dead by 1914.[81] Although habitat loss was a contributing factor, the species is
        thought to have been massively over-hunted, being used as food for slaves and, later, the poor, in the United
        States throughout the 19th century.[citation needed]


        The Socorro dove (Zenaida graysoni) is extinct in the wild.
        The dodo, and its extinction, was more typical of the extinctions of pigeons in general. Like many species that
        colonise remote islands with few predators, it lost much of its predator avoidance behaviour, along with its
        ability to fly.[82] The arrival of people, along with a suite of other introduced species such as rats, pigs,
        and cats, quickly spelled the end for this species and many other island species that have become extinct.[82]

        118 columbid species are at risk (34% of the total), with 48 species NT, 40 VU, 18 EN, 11 CR, and 1 EW.[4] Most
        of these are tropical and live on islands. All of the species are threatened by introduced predators, habitat
        loss, hunting, or a combination of these factors.[82] In some cases, they may be extinct in the wild, as is the
        Socorro dove of Socorro Island, Mexico, last seen in the wild in 1972, driven to extinction by habitat loss and
        introduced feral cats.[83] In some areas, a lack of knowledge means the true status of a species is unknown
        (DD); the Negros fruit dove has not been seen since 1953,[84] and may or may not be extinct, and the Polynesian
        ground dove is classified as critically endangered, as whether it survives or not on remote islands in the far
        west of the Pacific Ocean is unknown.[85]

        Various conservation techniques are employed to prevent these extinctions, including laws and regulations to
        control hunting pressure, the establishment of protected areas to prevent further habitat loss, the
        establishment of captive populations for reintroduction back into the wild (ex situ conservation), and the
        translocation of individuals to suitable habitats to create additional populations.[82][86]

        Domestication
        Main article: Domestic pigeon
        The domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica) is a descendant of the rock dove (Columba livia) that underwent
        domestication, with studies suggesting domestication as early as 10 thousand years ago. Domestic pigeons have
        long been a part of human culture; doves were important symbols of the goddesses Innana, Asherah, and Aphrodite,
        and revered by the early Christian, Islamic and Jewish religions. Domestication of pigeons led to significant
        use of homing pigeons for communication, including war pigeons, such as the 32 pigeons who were awarded the
        Dickin Medal for "brave service" to their country, in World War II.

        The ringneck dove is a smaller species of domestic columbid that was kept as a source of food. As a result of
        selection for tame individuals who would not escape their cages, they lack a survival instinct and cannot
        survive release.[87]

        Adult Eurasian goshawk
        Adult Eurasian goshawk
        Scientific classificationEdit this classification
        Kingdom: Animalia
        Phylum: Chordata
        Class: Aves
        Order: Accipitriformes
        Family: Accipitridae

        Sharp-shinned hawk, a small member of the Accipitrinae subfamily
        Hawks are birds of prey of the family Accipitridae. They are very widely distributed and are found on all
        continents, except Antarctica.[1]

        The subfamily Accipitrinae includes goshawks, sparrowhawks, sharp-shinned hawks, and others. This subfamily are
        mainly woodland birds with short broad wings, long tails, and high visual acuity. They hunt by dashing suddenly
        from a concealed perch.[2]

        In America, members of the Buteo group are also called hawks, though birds of this group are called buzzards in
        other parts of the world. Generally, buteos have broad wings and sturdy builds. They are relatively
        larger-winged and shorter-tailed than accipiters, and fly further distances in open areas. Buteos descend or
        pounce on their prey rather than engaging in fast, horizontal pursuit.

        The terms accipitrine hawk and buteonine hawk are used to distinguish between the types in regions where hawk
        applies to both. The term "true hawk" is sometimes used for the accipitrine hawks in regions where buzzard is
        preferred for the buteonine hawks.

        All these groups are members of the family Accipitridae, which includes hawks and buzzards as well as kites,
        harriers, and eagles. To confuse things further, some authors use "hawk" generally for any small to medium
        Accipitrid that is not an eagle.[3]


        A Red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), a member of the Buteo group
        The common names of some birds include the term "hawk", reflecting traditional usage rather than taxonomy. For
        example, some people may call an osprey a "fish hawk" or a peregrine falcon a "duck hawk".

        History
        Falconry was once called "hawking", and any bird used for falconry could be referred to as a hawk.[4]

        Aristotle listed eleven types of ἱέρακες (hierakes, hawks; singular ἱέραξ, hierax): aisalōn (merlin), asterias,
        hypotriorchēs, kirkos, leios, perkos, phassophonos, phrynologos, pternis, spizias, and triorchēs. Pliny numbered
        sixteen kinds of hawks, but named only aigithos, epileios, kenchrēïs (kestrel), kybindis, and triorchēs
        (buzzard).[5]

        Groups
        Accipiterine group
        Accipitrine hawks generally hunt other birds as their primary prey and thus are sometimes called "hen-hawks".
        Similarly, they are sometimes called "wood-hawks" because of their woodland habitat. Though they are also known
        as "true hawks" With most being called "sparrowhawks" or "goshawks" with the both being named such because of
        them hunting small birds (like sparrow) and large water-fowl (like goose) respectively

        The subfamily Accipitrinae contains the genus Accipiter as well as the genera Micronisus (Gabar goshawk),
        Urotriorchis (long-tailed hawk), and Megatriorchis (Doria's goshawk). Melierax (chanting goshawk) may be
        included in the subfamily or given a subfamily of its own.

        Erythrotriorchis (red- and chestnut-shouldered goshawk) is traditionally included in Accipitridae, but is
        possibly a convergent genus from an unrelated group (see red goshawk taxonomy).

        Buteonine group
        The "Buteonine group" includes genera Buteo, Parabuteo, Geranoetus, and most of Leucopternis. Members of this
        group have also been called "hawk-buzzards".[6]

        The proposed new genera Morphnarchus, Rupornis, and Pseudastur would be formed from members of Buteo and
        Leucopternis.[7]

        Members of the "Buteogallus group" are also called hawks, with the exception of solitary eagle species. Buteo is
        the type genus of the subfamily Buteoninae. This subfamily traditionally includes eagles and sea-eagles, but
        Lerner and Mindell (2005)[8] proposed placing them into separate the subfamilies Aquilinae and Haliaaetinae.
        This would leave only the buteonine hawks/buzzards in Buteoninae.

        Intelligence
        In February 2005, Canadian ornithologist Louis Lefebvre announced a method of measuring avian "IQ" by measuring
        their innovation in feeding habits. Based on this scale, hawks were named among the most intelligent birds.[9]

        Eyesight
        Hawks, like most birds, are tetrachromats with four types of colour receptors in the eye. Unlike some birds, but
        similar to other diurnal raptors, most hawk species are violet-sensitive but cannot perceive ultraviolet
        light.[10] Hawks also have relatively high visual acuity – the distance at which they can resolve an image –
        with red-tailed hawks reported to have 16.8 cycles per degree.[11] This is due to the large number of
        photoreceptors in the retina (up to 1,000,000 per square mm in Buteo, compared to 200,000 in humans), a high
        number of nerves connecting these receptors to the brain, and an indented fovea, which magnifies the central
        portion of the visual field.[12][13][14] Hawks additionally have two foveae (depressions in the retina with high
        photoreceptor density) in each eye, one centrally-placed and the other temporally-placed.[15] Finally, the
        eyeball is elongated, placing the lens far from the retina and giving a long focal length.[16]

        Migration
        Like most birds, hawks migrate in the autumn and the spring. The autumn migration season begins in August and
        ends mid-December, and different types of hawk choose different times in each season to migrate. Some migration
        distances are longer than others, and birds traveling longer distances tend to depart in early autumn while
        those traveling shorter distances start much later. Studies have shown that it is better for a hawk to arrive at
        its destination as early as possible to have first pick of mates, territory, food, and other resources.[17]

        There are a variety of factors impacting the strategy and success of a hawk's migration. Kerlinger states that a
        bird has more body fat when it begins its migration than when it arrives at its destination. Thus, the more fat
        a bird has when it begins its migration, the better its chances of making the trip safely. Flight path is
        another important factor in migration because a bird's route can greatly affect the conditions it encounters
        during its journey. For example, wind direction and speed can either throw the bird off course or push it in the
        right direction.[18] Due to the relative variability of air conditions over large bodies of water and the
        resulting impact on safety, hawks tend to avoid any large bodies of water while migrating by detouring around
        lakes or flying along coasts.[19]

        Hawkwatching is a citizen scientist activity that monitors hawk migration and provides data to the scientific
        community.

        Habitat and distribution
        See also: List of Accipitriformes by population
        The red-tailed hawk is probably the most common hawk in North America.[20]

        Past observations have indicated that, while hawks can easily adapt to most environments, they prefer open
        habitats such as deserts and fields, likely because it is easier to spot prey. As they are able to live
        anywhere, they can also be found in mountainous plains and tropical, moist areas such as Central America, the
        West Indies, and Jamaica.[21]

        Behavior
        Perch Hunting. This perching hawk located, captured and returned with prey at sunset
        Parents feed young hawks from early in their lives until they leave the nest.[22] Young hawks, while still in
        the fledgling phase, will leave their nests as early as six weeks old, but they do not hunt until they are
        older. Like most birds of prey, hawks kill their prey with their talons. Hawks usually prefer hunting just
        before nightfall when daylight lessens.[17] Although hawks are known for being violent predators, some are
        gentle and quiet.[citation needed]

        Hawks fly by flapping their wings rapidly then relying on momentum to glide through the air.[19] Like other
        birds, they are known to form flocks when migrating, which improves survival rates over traveling alone. Flocks
        of birds, especially hawks, are sometimes called "kettles" in the United States.[non sequitur][18]: 215–16 

        Reproduction
        Hawks are known for their unique mating season and means of reproduction.

        Some species of hawk are monogamous and have one partner their whole lives. The male and female of a mating pair
        build their nest before mating season then improve it throughout nesting season. They usually do this before
        mating.[19]

        Hawks have a striking mating ritual. First, a male and a female fly together in a circular motion. Once they
        reach a certain height, the male dives toward the female before ascending back to that height. The two birds
        repeat this until the male latches onto the female, and they begin to free-fall towards the ground.

        In one year, a female hawk will lay about five eggs. Both the male and the female guard and care for the eggs
        for about a month until they hatch.[22]

        Hawks feed on a variety of smaller animals such as snakes, lizards, fish, mice, rabbits, squirrels, birds, or
        any other type of small game that is found on the ground.[22] As an example, red-shouldered hawks eat smaller
        birds like doves as well as bugs like grasshoppers and crickets.[19]

        In culture
        Further information: Falconry
        The term war hawk, or simply hawk, is used in politics to describe someone perceived as favoring war. The term
        reportedly originated in the United States during the 1810 debates in Congress over a possible war with Great
        Britain. Congressman John Randolph is said to have referred to Henry Clay's pro-war faction as the
        "war-hawks".[23]

        Numerous sporting clubs, such as the Atlanta Hawks, the Hawthorn Hawks, and the Malmö Redhawks, use the bird as
        an emblem. The sports teams of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio officially became known as the RedHawks in 1997
        after changing the name from Redskins. The sports teams of Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia use the
        Hawk as an emblem for sports teams as well for students and graduates. The University of Iowa uses the name
        Hawkeyes for their sports teams. Although the name "Hawkeyes" is not derived from a hawk, they have Herky the
        Hawk as their mascot and a hawk head as their team logo.

        Hawks are strongly associated with Guru Gobind Singh in the Sikh community. He is believed to have kept a white
        Northern Goshawk. As a result, the Northern Goshawk was made the official state bird of Punjab,
        India.[24][25][26][27]

        In Korea, from the early Joseon period, hawks and other birds of prey were associated with a branch of
        government known as the Imperial Censorate, suggesting the qualities of courage and a keen sense of justice.
        Artists such as Chŏng Hongnae specialised in portraying hawks for royalty, and his Hawk at Sunrise is in the
        collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[28]

        Breeding range of penguins, all species (aqua); some species have wider seasonal migration ranges
        Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds from the family Spheniscidae (/sfɪˈnɪsɪdiː, -daɪ/) of the order
        Sphenisciformes (/sfɪˈnɪsəfɔːrmiːz/).[4] They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere. Only one
        species, the Galápagos penguin, is equatorial, with a small portion of its population extending slightly north
        of the equator (within a quarter degree of latitude). Highly adapted for life in the ocean water, penguins have
        countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and
        other forms of sea life which they catch with their bills and swallow whole while swimming. A penguin has a
        spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey.[5]

        They spend about half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea. The largest living species is the
        emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri):[6] on average, adults are about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg
        (77 lb). The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor), also known as the fairy
        penguin, which stands around 30–33 cm (12–13 in) tall and weighs 1.2–1.3 kg (2.6–2.9 lb).[7] Today, larger
        penguins generally inhabit colder regions, and smaller penguins inhabit regions with temperate or tropical
        climates. Some prehistoric penguin species were enormous: as tall or heavy as an adult human.[8] There was a
        great diversity of species in subantarctic regions, and at least one giant species in a region around 2,000 km
        south of the equator 35 mya, during the Late Eocene, a climate decidedly warmer than today.[9]

        Etymology

        The name penguin was first used in the late 16th century for the Great Auk (pictured here) and was later applied
        to Southern Hemisphere birds due to their resemblance, though they are not closely related.[10]
        The word penguin first appears in literature at the end of the 16th century as a synonym for the great auk.[11]
        When European explorers discovered what are today known as penguins in the Southern Hemisphere, they noticed
        their similar appearance to the great auk of the Northern Hemisphere and named them after this bird, although
        they are not closely related.[12]

        The etymology of the word penguin is still debated. The English word is not apparently of French,[13] Breton[14]
        or Spanish[15] origin (the latter two are attributed to the French word pingouin), but first appears in English
        or Dutch.[13]

        Some dictionaries suggest a derivation from Welsh pen, 'head' and gwyn, 'white',[16] including the Oxford
        English Dictionary, the American Heritage Dictionary,[17] the Century Dictionary[17] and Merriam-Webster,[18] on
        the basis that the name was originally applied to the great auk, either because it was found on White Head
        Island (Welsh: Pen Gwyn) in Newfoundland, or because it had white circles around its eyes (though the head was
        black). However, the Welsh word pen can also be used to mean 'front' and, in a maritime context, pen blaen means
        'front end or part, bow (of a ship), prow'.[19]

        An alternative etymology links the word to Latin pinguis, which means 'fat' or 'oil'.[20] Support for this
        etymology can be found in the alternative Germanic word for penguin, fettgans or 'fat-goose', and the related
        Dutch word vetgans.

        Adult male penguins are sometimes called cocks, females sometimes called hens; a group of penguins on land is a
        waddle, and a group of penguins in the water is a raft.

        Pinguinus
        Main article: Great auk
        Since 1871, the Latin word Pinguinus has been used in scientific classification to name the genus of the great
        auk (Pinguinus impennis, meaning "plump or fat without flight feathers"),[10] which became extinct in the
        mid-19th century.[11] As confirmed by a 2004 genetic study, the genus Pinguinus belongs in the family of the
        auks (Alcidae), within the order of the Charadriiformes.[21][22]

        The birds currently known as penguins were discovered later and were so named by sailors because of their
        physical resemblance to the great auk. Despite this resemblance, however, they are not auks, and are not closely
        related to the great auk.[12][10] They do not belong in the genus Pinguinus, and are not classified in the same
        family and order as the great auk. They were classified in 1831 by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in several distinct
        genera within the family Spheniscidae and order Sphenisciformes.

        Systematics and evolution
        Taxonomy
        Main article: List of penguins
        The family name of Spheniscidae was given by Charles Lucien Bonaparte from the genus Spheniscus,[23] the name of
        that genus comes from the Greek word σφήν sphēn "wedge" used for the shape of an African penguin's swimming
        flippers.[24]

        Some recent sources[3][25] apply the phylogenetic taxon Spheniscidae to what here is referred to as
        Spheniscinae. Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon Sphenisciformes to flightless taxa, and
        establish the phylogenetic taxon Pansphenisciformes as equivalent to the Linnean taxon Sphenisciformes,[25]
        i.e., including any flying basal "proto-penguins" to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the
        relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian phylogeny
        is presently resolved, this is confusing, so the established Linnean system is followed here.

        The number of penguin species is typically listed as between seventeen and nineteen.[26] The International
        Ornithologists' Union recognizes six genera and eighteen species:[27]

        Evolution

        Penguin tracks in the sand on Bruny Island, Tasmania
        Although the evolutionary and biogeographic history of Sphenisciformes is well-researched, many prehistoric
        forms are not fully described. Some seminal articles about the evolutionary history of penguins have been
        published since 2005.[3][28][29][30][excessive citations]

        The basal penguins lived around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event in the general area of
        southern New Zealand and Byrd Land, Antarctica.[3] Due to plate tectonics, these areas were at that time less
        than 1,500 kilometres (930 mi) apart rather than 4,000 kilometres (2,500 mi). The most recent common ancestor of
        penguins and Procellariiformes can be roughly dated to the Campanian–Maastrichtian boundary, around 70–68
        mya.[28][30][31]

        Basal fossils
        The oldest known fossil penguin species are known from the Waipara Greensand of New Zealand, which spans the
        late Danian to early Thanetian stages (~62.5–58 Ma) of the Paleocene epoch. Several genera have been named from
        these outcrops, including Archaeodyptes, Daniadyptes, Muriwaimanu, Sequiwaimanu, Waimanu, Waimanutaha, and
        Waiparadyptes.[32] While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins, they were still
        flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving.[30] They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but
        the wings were—as opposed to most other diving birds (both living and extinct)—already adapting to underwater
        locomotion.[33]

        Perudyptes from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from Argentina proves that, by the
        Bartonian (Middle Eocene), some 39–38 mya,[34] primitive penguins had spread to South America and were in the
        process of expanding into Atlantic waters.[25]

        Palaeeudyptines
        During the Late Eocene and the Early Oligocene (40–30 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed.
        Nordenskjoeld's giant penguin was the tallest, growing nearly 1.80 meters (5.9 feet) tall. The New Zealand giant
        penguin was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kilograms (180 lb) or more. Both were found on New Zealand, the
        former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards.

        Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the paraphyletic subfamily
        called Palaeeudyptinae. More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the phylogeny if possible,
        it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones
        occurred in Patagonia, and at least one other—which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today –
        occurred on most Antarctic and Subantarctic coasts.

        Size plasticity was significant at this initial stage of radiation: on Seymour Island, Antarctica, for example,
        around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to large apparently coexisted some 35 mya during
        the Priabonian (Late Eocene).[35] It is not known whether the palaeeudyptines constitute a monophyletic lineage,
        or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae –
        whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as
        delimited (i.e., including Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi).[3] The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot
        (1.5 m)-tall Icadyptes salasi, existed as far north as northern Peru about 36 mya.

        Gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the Paleogene, around 25 mya. Their decline and disappearance
        coincided with the spread of the Squalodontidae and other primitive, fish-eating toothed whales, which competed
        with them for food and were ultimately more successful.[28] A new lineage, the Paraptenodytes, which includes
        smaller and stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early Neogene
        saw the emergence of another morphotype in the same area, the similarly sized but more gracile
        Palaeospheniscinae, as well as the radiation that gave rise to the current biodiversity of penguins.

        Origin and systematics of modern penguins
        Modern penguins constitute two undisputed clades and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous
        relationships.[29] To help resolve the evolution of this order, 19 high-coverage genomes that, together with two
        previously published genomes, encompass all extant penguin species have been sequenced.[36] The origin of the
        Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene and, geographically, it must have been much the same as the
        general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the
        Antarctic.[28] Presumably diverging from other penguins around 40 mya,[28] it seems that the Spheniscinae were
        for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the Antarctic Peninsula
        and Patagonia have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are
        those with the most southern distribution.

        The genus Aptenodytes appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins.[3][37] They have bright
        yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch
        the chicks are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centred on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to
        some Subantarctic islands today.

        Pygoscelis contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is
        intermediate, centred on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external morphology,
        these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as Aptenodytes' autapomorphies are, in
        most cases, fairly pronounced adaptations related to that genus' extreme habitat conditions. As the former
        genus, Pygoscelis seems to have diverged during the Bartonian,[38] but the range expansion and radiation that
        led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the Burdigalian stage of the
        Early Miocene, roughly 20–15 mya.[28]

        The genera Spheniscus and Eudyptula contain species with a mostly Subantarctic distribution centred on South
        America; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack carotenoid colouration and the former genus
        has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group
        probably radiated eastwards with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current out of the ancestral range of modern penguins
        throughout the Chattian (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya.[28] While the two genera separated
        during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a Pliocene radiation, taking place some 4–2
        mya.[28]

        The Megadyptes–Eudyptes clade occurs at similar latitudes (though not as far north as the Galápagos penguin),
        has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represents a westward dispersal. They are characterized
        by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged
        apparently in the Middle Miocene (Langhian, roughly 15–14 mya), although the living species of Eudyptes are the
        product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late Tortonian (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the
        Pliocene.[28]

        Geography
        The geographical and temporal pattern of spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of global
        cooling documented in the paleoclimatic record.[28] The emergence of the Subantarctic lineage at the end of the
        Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the ice ages some 35
        million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable
        conditions for most penguins existed in the Subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself.[39] Notably,
        the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the
        one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of Spheniscus to
        South America and eventually beyond.[28] Despite this, there is no fossil evidence to support the idea of crown
        radiation from the Antarctic continent in the Paleogene, although DNA study favors such a radiation.[39]

        Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the Middle Miocene Climate Transition, a sharp drop
        in global average temperature from 14 to 12 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya;
        by the end of the Tortonian, the Antarctic ice sheet was already much like today in volume and extent. The
        emergence of most of today's Subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of
        Neogene climate shifts.

        Relationship to other bird orders
        Penguin ancestry beyond Waimanu remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses.
        The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes
        perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and grebes is almost certainly an error based on both
        groups' strong diving adaptations, which are homoplasies. On the other hand, different DNA sequence datasets do
        not agree in detail with each other either.

        What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except for paleognaths and fowl)
        that comprises what is sometimes called "higher waterbirds" to distinguish them from the more ancient waterfowl.
        This group contains such birds as storks, rails, and the seabirds, with the possible exception of the
        Charadriiformes.[40]

        Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close
        relationship to Ciconiiformes[30] or to Procellariiformes[28] has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like
        plotopterids (usually considered relatives of cormorants and anhingas) may actually be a sister group of the
        penguins and those penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the Pelecaniformes and
        consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other
        pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes into
        three.[41]

        A 2014 analysis of whole genomes of 48 representative bird species has concluded that penguins are the sister
        group of Procellariiformes,[42] from which they diverged about 60 million years ago (95% CI, 56.8–62.7).[43]

        The distantly related puffins, which live in the North Pacific and North Atlantic, developed similar
        characteristics to survive in the Arctic and sub-Arctic environments. Like the penguins, puffins have a white
        chest, black back and short stubby wings providing excellent swimming ability in icy water. But, unlike
        penguins, puffins can fly, as flightless birds would not survive alongside land-based predators such as polar
        bears and foxes; there are no such predators in the Antarctic. Their similarities indicate that similar
        environments, although at great distances, can result in similar evolutionary developments, i.e. convergent
        evolution.[44]

        Anatomy and physiology

        Penguin wings have the same general bone structure as flighted birds, but the bones are shorter and stouter to
        allow them to serve as fins. 1). Humerus 2). Sesamoid Bone 3). Radius 4). Ulna 5). Radial Carpal bone 6).

        Taxidermized penguin skin
        Penguins are superbly adapted to aquatic life. Their wings have evolved to become flippers, useless for flight
        in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Penguins' swimming looks very similar to
        birds' flight in the air.[45] Within the smooth plumage a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air
        layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their tails and wings to maintain
        balance for their upright stance.

        All penguins are countershaded for camouflage – that is, they have black backs and wings with white fronts.[46]
        A predator looking up from below (such as an orca or a leopard seal) has difficulty distinguishing between a
        white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from
        above.

        Gentoo penguins are the fastest underwater birds in the world. They are capable of reaching speeds up to 36 km
        (about 22 miles) per hour while searching for food or escaping from predators. They are also able to dive to
        depths of 170–200 meters (about 560–660 feet).[47] The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their
        prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case
        of need. Emperor penguins are the world's deepest-diving birds. They can dive to depths of approximately 550
        meters (1,800 feet) while searching for food.[48]

        Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow while using their feet to propel
        and steer themselves, a movement called "tobogganing", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also
        jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.

        Penguins have an average sense of hearing for birds;[49] this is used by parents and chicks to locate one
        another in crowded colonies.[50] Their eyes are adapted for underwater vision and are their primary means of
        locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are nearsighted, although research
        has not supported this hypothesis.[51]


        Gentoo penguin swimming underwater at the Nagasaki Penguin Aquarium
        Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers that keeps them warm in water (heat loss in water is much
        greater than in air). The emperor penguin has a maximum feather density of about nine feathers per square
        centimeter which is actually much lower than other birds that live in Antarctic environments. However, they have
        been identified as having at least four different types of feather: in addition to the traditional feather, the
        emperor has afterfeathers, plumules, and filoplumes. The afterfeathers are downy plumes that attach directly to
        the main feathers and were once believed to account for the bird's ability to conserve heat when under water;
        the plumules are small down feathers that attach directly to the skin, and are much more dense in penguins than
        other birds; lastly the filoplumes are small (less than 1 cm long) naked shafts that end in a splay of fibers—
        filoplumes were believed to give flying birds a sense of where their plumage was and whether or not it needed
        preening, so their presence in penguins may seem inconsistent, but penguins also preen extensively.[52]

        The emperor penguin has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and
        heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood that gets
        cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females
        are at sea fishing for food, leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to
        keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the centre of the heat pack.

        Calculations of the heat loss and retention ability of marine endotherms[53] suggest that most extant penguins
        are too small to survive in such cold environments.[54] In 2007, Thomas and Fordyce wrote about the
        "heterothermic loophole" that penguins utilize in order to survive in Antarctica.[55] All extant penguins, even
        those that live in warmer climates, have a counter-current heat exchanger called the humeral plexus. The
        flippers of penguins have at least three branches of the axillary artery, which allows cold blood to be heated
        by blood that has already been warmed and limits heat loss from the flippers. This system allows penguins to
        efficiently use their body heat and explains why such small animals can survive in the extreme cold.[56]

        They can drink salt water because their supraorbital gland filters excess salt from the bloodstream.[57][58][59]
        The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.

        The great auk of the Northern Hemisphere, now extinct, was superficially similar to penguins, and the word
        penguin was originally used for that bird centuries ago. They are only distantly related to the penguins, but
        are an example of convergent evolution.[60]

        Around one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called
        isabelline penguins. Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives
        than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep and are often passed over as mates.

        Breeding

        Gentoo penguin watching over a sleeping chick at Brown Bluff
        Penguins for the most part breed in large colonies, the exceptions being the yellow-eyed and Fiordland species;
        these colonies may range in size from as few as 100 pairs for gentoo penguins to several hundred thousand in the
        case of king, macaroni and chinstrap penguins.[61] Living in colonies results in a high level of social
        interaction between birds, which has led to a large repertoire of visual as well as vocal displays in all
        penguin species.[62] Agonistic displays are those intended to confront or drive off, or alternately appease and
        avoid conflict with, other individuals.[62]

        Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies
        drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, although the two largest species, the emperor and the king
        penguins, lay only one.[63] With the exception of the emperor penguin, where the male does it all, all penguins
        share the incubation duties.[64] These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair
        feeds at sea.

        Penguins generally only lay one brood; the exception is the little penguin, which can raise two or three broods
        in a season.[65]

        Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent
        birds; at 52 g (2 oz), the little penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450 g (1 lb) emperor
        penguin egg is 2.3%.[63] The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg,
        presumably to reduce the effects of dehydration and to minimize the risk of breakage in an adverse nesting
        environment.[66] The yolk, too, is large and comprises 22–31% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick
        is born, and is thought to help sustain the chick if the parents are delayed in returning with food.[67]

        When emperor penguin mothers lose a chick, they sometimes attempt to "steal" another mother's chick, usually
        unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick.[68] In some
        species, such as emperor and king penguins, the chicks assemble in large groups called crèches.

        Distribution and habitat
        See also: List of Sphenisciformes by population
        Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold
        climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. Several species
        live in the temperate zone;[69][failed verification] one, the Galápagos penguin, lives as far north as the
        Galápagos Islands, but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic Humboldt Current
        that flows around these islands.[70] Also, though the climate of the Arctic and Antarctic regions is similar,
        there are no penguins found in the Arctic.[71]


        Gálapagos Penguins near Isabela Island
        Several authors have suggested that penguins are a good example of Bergmann's Rule[72][73] where larger-bodied
        populations live at higher latitudes than smaller-bodied populations. There is some disagreement about this and
        several other authors have noted that there are fossil penguin species that contradict this hypothesis and that
        ocean currents and upwellings are likely to have had a greater effect on species diversity than latitude
        alone.[74][75]

        Major populations of penguins are found in Angola, Antarctica, Argentina, Australia, Chile, Namibia, New
        Zealand, and South Africa.[76][77] Satellite images and photos released in 2018 show the population of 2 million
        in France's remote Ile aux Cochons has collapsed, with barely 200,000 remaining, according to a study published
        in Antarctic Science.[78]

        Conservation status
        The majority of living penguin species have declining populations. According to the IUCN Red List, their
        conservation statuses range from Least Concern through to Endangered.

        Penguins and humans

        An Adélie penguin encountering a human during the Antarctic summer
        Penguins have no special fear of humans and will often approach groups of people. This is probably because
        penguins have no land predators in Antarctica or the nearby offshore islands. They are preyed upon by other
        birds like skuas, especially in eggs and as fledglings. Other birds like petrels, sheathbills, and gulls also
        eat the chicks. Dogs preyed upon penguins while they were allowed in Antarctica during the age of early human
        exploration as sled dogs, but dogs have long since been banned from Antarctica.[97] Instead, adult penguins are
        at risk at sea from predators such as sharks, orcas, and leopard seals. Typically, penguins do not approach
        closer than around 9 feet (2.7 meters), at which point they appear to become nervous.[98]

        In June 2011, an emperor penguin came ashore on New Zealand's Peka Peka Beach, 3,200 kilometres (2,000 mi) off
        course on its journey to Antarctica.[99] Nicknamed Happy Feet, after the film of the same name, it was suffering
        from heat exhaustion and had to undergo a number of operations to remove objects like driftwood and sand from
        its stomach.[100] Happy Feet was a media sensation, with extensive coverage on TV and the web, including a live
        stream that had thousands of views[101] and a visit from English actor Stephen Fry.[102] Once he had recovered,
        Happy Feet was released back into the water south of New Zealand.[103]

        In popular culture
        Main article: Cultural depictions of penguins

        Tux, the mascot of the Linux kernel
        Penguins are widely considered endearing for their unusually upright, waddling gait, swimming ability and
        (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their black-and-white plumage is often likened to a white tie
        suit. Some writers and artists have penguins based at the North Pole, but there are no wild penguins in the
        Arctic. The cartoon series Chilly Willy helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interact with
        Arctic or sub-Arctic species, such as polar bears and walruses.

        Penguins have been the subject of many books and films, such as Happy Feet, Surf's Up and Penguins of
        Madagascar, all CGI films; March of the Penguins, a documentary based on the migration process of the emperor
        penguin; and Farce of the Penguins, a parody of the documentary. Mr. Popper's Penguins is a children's book
        written by Richard and Florence Atwater; it was named a Newbery Honor Book in 1939. Penguins have also appeared
        in a number of cartoons and television dramas, including Pingu, co-created by Otmar Gutmann and Erika
        Brueggemann in 1990 and covering more than 100 short episodes. At the end of 2009, Entertainment Weekly put it
        on its end-of-the-decade "best-of" list, saying, "Whether they were walking (March of the Penguins), dancing
        (Happy Feet), or hanging ten (Surf's Up), these oddly adorable birds took flight at the box office all decade
        long."[104]

        A video game called Pengo was released by Sega in 1982. Set in Antarctica, the player controls a penguin
        character who must navigate mazes of ice cubes. The player is rewarded with cut-scenes of animated penguins
        marching, dancing, saluting and playing peekaboo. Several remakes and enhanced editions have followed, most
        recently in 2012. Penguins are also sometimes depicted in music.[105]

        In 1941, DC Comics introduced the avian-themed character of the Penguin as a supervillain adversary of the
        superhero Batman (Detective Comics #58). He became one of the most enduring enemies in Batman's rogues gallery.
        In the 60s Batman TV series, as played by Burgess Meredith, he was one of the most popular characters, and in
        Tim Burton's reimagining of the story, the character played by Danny Devito in the 1992 film Batman Returns,
        employed an actual army of penguins (mostly African penguins and king penguins).

        Several pro, minor, college and high school sport teams in the United States have named themselves after the
        species, including the Pittsburgh Penguins team in the National Hockey League and the Youngstown State Penguins
        in college athletics.

        Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of U.K. cartoonist Steve Bell in his strip in The Guardian
        newspaper, particularly during and following the Falklands War. Opus the Penguin, from the cartoons of Berkeley
        Breathed, is also described as hailing from the Falklands. Opus was a comical, "existentialist" penguin
        character in the cartoons Bloom County, Outland and Opus. He was also the star in the animated Christmas TV
        special A Wish for Wings That Work.

        In the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting homosexual
        couples. A children's book, And Tango Makes Three, was written about one such penguin family in the New York
        Zoo.

        Duck is the common name for numerous species of waterfowl in the family Anatidae. Ducks are generally smaller
        and shorter-necked than swans and geese, which are members of the same family. Divided among several
        subfamilies, they are a form taxon; they do not represent a monophyletic group (the group of all descendants of
        a single common ancestral species), since swans and geese are not considered ducks. Ducks are mostly aquatic
        birds, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water.

        Ducks are sometimes confused with several types of unrelated water birds with similar forms, such as loons or
        divers, grebes, gallinules and coots.

        Etymology
        The word duck comes from Old English dūce 'diver', a derivative of the verb *dūcan 'to duck, bend down low as if
        to get under something, or dive', because of the way many species in the dabbling duck group feed by upending;
        compare with Dutch duiken and German tauchen 'to dive'.

        This word replaced Old English ened /ænid 'duck', possibly to avoid confusion with other words, such as ende
        'end' with similar forms. Other Germanic languages still have similar words for duck, for example, Dutch eend,
        German Ente and Norwegian and. The word ened /ænid was inherited from Proto-Indo-European; cf. Latin anas
        "duck", Lithuanian ántis 'duck', Ancient Greek νῆσσα /νῆττα (nēssa /nētta) 'duck', and Sanskrit ātí 'water
        bird', among others.

        A duckling is a young duck in downy plumage[1] or baby duck,[2] but in the food trade a young domestic duck
        which has just reached adult size and bulk and its meat is still fully tender, is sometimes labelled as a
        duckling.

        A male is called a drake and the female is called a duck, or in ornithology a hen.[3][4]

        Taxonomy
        All ducks belong to the biological order Anseriformes, a group that contains the ducks, geese and swans, as well
        as the screamers, and the magpie goose.[5] All except the screamers belong to the biological family Anatidae.[5]
        Within the family, ducks are split into a variety of subfamilies and 'tribes'. The number and composition of
        these subfamilies and tribes is the cause of considerable disagreement among taxonomists.[5] Some base their
        decisions on morphological characteristics, others on shared behaviours or genetic studies.[6][7] The number of
        suggested subfamilies containing ducks ranges from two to five.[8][9] The significant level of hybridisation
        that occurs among wild ducks complicates efforts to tease apart the relationships between various species.[9]


        Mallard landing in approach
        In most modern classifications, the so-called 'true ducks' belong to the subfamily Anatinae, which is further
        split into a varying number of tribes.[10] The largest of these, the Anatini, contains the 'dabbling' or 'river'
        ducks – named for their method of feeding primarily at the surface of fresh water.[11] The 'diving ducks', also
        named for their primary feeding method, make up the tribe Aythyini.[12] The 'sea ducks' of the tribe Mergini are
        diving ducks which specialise on fish and shellfish and spend a majority of their lives in saltwater.[13] The
        tribe Oxyurini contains the 'stifftails', diving ducks notable for their small size and stiff, upright
        tails.[14]

        A number of other species called ducks are not considered to be 'true ducks', and are typically placed in other
        subfamilies or tribes. The whistling ducks are assigned either to a tribe (Dendrocygnini) in the subfamily
        Anatinae or the subfamily Anserinae,[15] or to their own subfamily (Dendrocygninae) or family
        (Dendrocyganidae).[9][16] The freckled duck of Australia is either the sole member of the tribe Stictonettini in
        the subfamily Anserinae,[15] or in its own family, the Stictonettinae.[9] The shelducks make up the tribe
        Tadornini in the family Anserinae in some classifications,[15] and their own subfamily, Tadorninae, in
        others,[17] while the steamer ducks are either placed in the family Anserinae in the tribe Tachyerini[15] or
        lumped with the shelducks in the tribe Tadorini.[9] The perching ducks make up in the tribe Cairinini in the
        subfamily Anserinae in some classifications, while that tribe is eliminated in other classifications and its
        members assigned to the tribe Anatini.[9] The torrent duck is generally included in the subfamily Anserinae in
        the monotypic tribe Merganettini,[15] but is sometimes included in the tribe Tadornini.[18] The pink-eared duck
        is sometimes included as a true duck either in the tribe Anatini[15] or the tribe Malacorhynchini,[19] and other
        times is included with the shelducks in the tribe Tadornini.[15]

        The overall body plan of ducks is elongated and broad, and they are also relatively long-necked, albeit not as
        long-necked as the geese and swans. The body shape of diving ducks varies somewhat from this in being more
        rounded. The bill is usually broad and contains serrated pectens, which are particularly well defined in the
        filter-feeding species. In the case of some fishing species the bill is long and strongly serrated. The scaled
        legs are strong and well developed, and generally set far back on the body, more so in the highly aquatic
        species, which typically feature webbed feet. The wings are very strong and are generally short and pointed, and
        the flight of ducks requires fast continuous strokes, requiring in turn strong wing muscles. Three species of
        steamer duck are almost flightless, however. Many species of duck are temporarily flightless while moulting;
        they seek out protected habitat with good food supplies during this period. This moult typically precedes
        migration.

        The drakes of northern species often have extravagant plumage, but that is moulted in summer to give a more
        female-like appearance, the "eclipse" plumage. Southern resident species typically show less sexual dimorphism,
        although there are exceptions such as the paradise shelduck of New Zealand, which is both strikingly sexually
        dimorphic and in which the female's plumage is brighter than that of the male. The plumage of juvenile birds
        generally resembles that of the female. Female ducks have evolved to have a corkscrew shaped vagina to prevent
        forced copulations.[20]

        Distribution and habitat
        See also: List of Anseriformes by population

        Flying steamer ducks in Ushuaia, Argentina
        Ducks have a cosmopolitan distribution, and are found on every continent except Antarctica.[5] Several species
        manage to live on subantarctic islands, including South Georgia and the Auckland Islands.[21] Ducks have reached
        a number of isolated oceanic islands, including the Hawaiian Islands, Micronesia and the Galápagos Islands,
        where they are often vagrants and less often residents.[22][23] A handful are endemic to such far-flung
        islands.[22]

        Some duck species, mainly those breeding in the temperate and Arctic Northern Hemisphere, are migratory; those
        in the tropics are generally not. Some ducks, particularly in Australia where rainfall is erratic, are nomadic,
        seeking out the temporary lakes and pools that form after localised heavy rain.[24]

        Behaviour
        Feeding

        Pecten along the bill
        Mallard duckling preening
        Ducks eat food sources such as grasses, aquatic plants, fish, insects, small amphibians, worms, and small
        molluscs.

        Dabbling ducks feed on the surface of water or on land, or as deep as they can reach by up-ending without
        completely submerging.[25] Along the edge of the bill, there is a comb-like structure called a pecten. This
        strains the water squirting from the side of the bill and traps any food. The pecten is also used to preen
        feathers and to hold slippery food items.

        Diving ducks and sea ducks forage deep underwater. To be able to submerge more easily, the diving ducks are
        heavier than dabbling ducks, and therefore have more difficulty taking off to fly.

        A few specialized species such as the mergansers are adapted to catch and swallow large fish.

        The others have the characteristic wide flat bill adapted to dredging-type jobs such as pulling up waterweed,
        pulling worms and small molluscs out of mud, searching for insect larvae, and bulk jobs such as dredging out,
        holding, turning head first, and swallowing a squirming frog. To avoid injury when digging into sediment it has
        no cere, but the nostrils come out through hard horn.

        The Guardian published an article advising that ducks should not be fed with bread because it damages the health
        of the ducks and pollutes waterways.[26]

        Breeding

        A Muscovy duckling
        Ducks generally only have one partner at a time, although the partnership usually only lasts one year.[27]
        Larger species and the more sedentary species (like fast-river specialists) tend to have pair-bonds that last
        numerous years.[28] Most duck species breed once a year, choosing to do so in favourable conditions
        (spring/summer or wet seasons). Ducks also tend to make a nest before breeding, and, after hatching, lead their
        ducklings to water. Mother ducks are very caring and protective of their young, but may abandon some of their
        ducklings if they are physically stuck in an area they cannot get out of (such as nesting in an enclosed
        courtyard) or are not prospering due to genetic defects or sickness brought about by hypothermia, starvation, or
        disease. Ducklings can also be orphaned by inconsistent late hatching where a few eggs hatch after the mother
        has abandoned the nest and led her ducklings to water.[29]

        Communication
        Female mallard ducks (as well as several other species in the genus Anas, such as the American and Pacific black
        ducks, spot-billed duck, northern pintail and common teal) make the classic "quack" sound while males make a
        similar but raspier sound that is sometimes written as "breeeeze",[30][self-published source?] but, despite
        widespread misconceptions, most species of duck do not "quack".[31] In general, ducks make a range of calls,
        including whistles, cooing, yodels and grunts. For example, the scaup – which are diving ducks – make a noise
        like "scaup" (hence their name). Calls may be loud displaying calls or quieter contact calls.

        A common urban legend claims that duck quacks do not echo; however, this has been proven to be false. This myth
        was first debunked by the Acoustics Research Centre at the University of Salford in 2003 as part of the British
        Association's Festival of Science.[32] It was also debunked in one of the earlier episodes of the popular
        Discovery Channel television show MythBusters.[33]

        Predators

        Ringed teal
        Ducks have many predators. Ducklings are particularly vulnerable, since their inability to fly makes them easy
        prey not only for predatory birds but also for large fish like pike, crocodilians, predatory testudines such as
        the alligator snapping turtle, and other aquatic hunters, including fish-eating birds such as herons. Ducks'
        nests are raided by land-based predators, and brooding females may be caught unaware on the nest by mammals,
        such as foxes, or large birds, such as hawks or owls.

        Adult ducks are fast fliers, but may be caught on the water by large aquatic predators including big fish such
        as the North American muskie and the European pike. In flight, ducks are safe from all but a few predators such
        as humans and the peregrine falcon, which uses its speed and strength to catch ducks.

        Relationship with humans
        Hunting
        Main article: Waterfowl hunting
        Humans have hunted ducks since prehistoric times. Excavations of middens in California dating to 7800 – 6400 BP
        have turned up bones of ducks, including at least one now-extinct flightless species.[34] Ducks were captured in
        "significant numbers" by Holocene inhabitants of the lower Ohio River valley, suggesting they took advantage of
        the seasonal bounty provided by migrating waterfowl.[35] Neolithic hunters in locations as far apart as the
        Caribbean,[36] Scandinavia,[37] Egypt,[38] Switzerland,[39] and China relied on ducks as a source of protein for
        some or all of the year.[40] Archeological evidence shows that Māori people in New Zealand hunted the flightless
        Finsch's duck, possibly to extinction, though rat predation may also have contributed to its fate.[41] A similar
        end awaited the Chatham duck, a species with reduced flying capabilities which went extinct shortly after its
        island was colonised by Polynesian settlers.[42] It is probable that duck eggs were gathered by Neolithic
        hunter-gathers as well, though hard evidence of this is uncommon.[36][43]

        In many areas, wild ducks (including ducks farmed and released into the wild) are hunted for food or sport,[44]
        by shooting, or by being trapped using duck decoys. Because an idle floating duck or a duck squatting on land
        cannot react to fly or move quickly, "a sitting duck" has come to mean "an easy target". These ducks may be
        contaminated by pollutants such as PCBs.[45]

        Domestication
        Main article: Domestic duck

        Indian Runner ducks, a common breed of domestic ducks
        Ducks have many economic uses, being farmed for their meat, eggs, and feathers (particularly their down).
        Approximately 3 billion ducks are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide.[46] They are also kept and bred by
        aviculturists and often displayed in zoos. Almost all the varieties of domestic ducks are descended from the
        mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), apart from the Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata).[47][48] The Call duck is another
        example of a domestic duck breed. Its name comes from its original use established by hunters, as a decoy to
        attract wild mallards from the sky, into traps set for them on the ground. The call duck is the world's smallest
        domestic duck breed, as it weighs less than 1 kg (2.2 lb).[49]

        Heraldry

        Three black-colored ducks in the coat of arms of Maaninka[50]
        Ducks appear on several coats of arms, including the coat of arms of Lubāna (Latvia)[51] and the coat of arms of
        Föglö (Åland).[52]

        Cultural references
        In 2002, psychologist Richard Wiseman and colleagues at the University of Hertfordshire, UK, finished a
        year-long LaughLab experiment, concluding that of all animals, ducks attract the most humor and silliness; he
        said, "If you're going to tell a joke involving an animal, make it a duck."[53] The word "duck" may have become
        an inherently funny word in many languages, possibly because ducks are seen as silly in their looks or behavior.
        Of the many ducks in fiction, many are cartoon characters, such as Walt Disney's Donald Duck, and Warner Bros.'
        Daffy Duck. Howard the Duck started as a comic book character in 1973[54][55] and was made into a movie in 1986.

        The 1992 Disney film The Mighty Ducks, starring Emilio Estevez, chose the duck as the mascot for the fictional
        youth hockey team who are protagonists of the movie, based on the duck being described as a fierce fighter. This
        led to the duck becoming the nickname and mascot for the eventual National Hockey League professional team of
        the Anaheim Ducks, who were founded with the name the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.[56] The duck is also the nickname
        of the University of Oregon sports teams as well as the Long Island Ducks minor league baseball team.[57]
